- **Paul Graham**
    - I think website is too plain and bone, needs more styling
    - everything isn't sized correctly, too small and doesn't utilize the full webpage

- **Supreme**
    - nice and simple homepage
        - utilizes full webpage, font sizing is large enough that the words aren't too hard too see, good contrast.
    - Website is also too plain for my liking.
