# It's time to write your first multiline of code in Python. Use the print to send a multiline message with a quote in it to the terminal.

# Here is an example of using print to display message to the user:

print('''In this code include "quotes"
of any kind because they won't get confused with
the end of the string!''')

#printing a new line to separate the messages.

print("\n")
# Display your own message using print below:

print(''' Using triple apostrophes allow me to write a message that
take up multiple lines. Python won't think that this is another
function to run ''')
