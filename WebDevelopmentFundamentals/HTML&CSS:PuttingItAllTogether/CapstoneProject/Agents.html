                <p>
                    Controllers are delegated the role of providing cover and/or denying vision for the players in the
                    game. They all have utility to deny vision by placing smokes on the map. While they all have a "smoking"
                    ability, the way each character implements this ability is unique. As we go over each agent, we'll discuss each
                    agents abilities, and how their smoking ability is implemented.

                        <p>
                            Ghanaian Agent Astra harnesses the energies of the cosmos to reshape battlefields to her
                            whim. With full command of her astral form and a talent for deep strategic foresight, she's
                            always eons ahead of her enemy's next move. Astra has four abilities: GRAVITY WELL, NOVA PULSE,
                            NEBULA and DISSIPATE, and her Unique ability/Ultimate ability ASTRAL FORM/COSMIC DIVIDE. Even
                            when comparing all the controllers with each other, Astra is uniquely different from the rest.
                            With her unique ability Astral Form, Astra enters an Astral Form and is able to place "stars"
                            on the map and with these "stars" Astra is able to activate any one of her abilities on these
                            "stars". Gravity Well pulls players within the radius of the ability towards the center before
                            it explodes. Any players trapped inside will become fragile and will take more damage for a
                            short amount of time. Nova Pulse charges for a brief amount of time and will concuss all players
                            within the radius of the ability. Concussed players will have vision blur, reduced movement speed,
                            and slower fire-rate. Nebula is Astra's signature ability and her smoking ability. There will be a
                            smoke placed where the "star" was placed and it will deny vision for a brief amount of time. Dissipate
                            allows Astra players to retrieve their "star" to be placed somewhere else after a cooldown duration.
                            When players retrieve their "stars" it'll leave a smoke that will last an even shorter duration than
                            the Nebula ability. The inside of Nebula is hollow , which means that if 2 players were to walk into
                            Nebula they will be able to see each other in the smoke. Astra's Ultimate Ability is called Cosmic
                            Divide. You'll need to charge this ability up by killing enemies, planting the bomb or dying. Each
                            of previous actions will provide the ability with 1 charge. Cosmic Divide creates an infinite wall
                            that blocks bullets from going through and heavily dampens audio from the other side of the wall.
                            However abilities are still free to travel through the wall.

                        <p>
                            Joining from the USA, Brimstone's orbital arsenal ensures his squad always has the
                            advantage. His ability to deliver utility precisely and from a distance makes him
                            an unmatched boots-on-the-ground commander. Brimstone has four abilities: Stim Beacon,
                            Incendiary, Sky Smoke, and his ultimate ability Orbital Strike. Brimstone is the mosst
                            straight forward of all the controllers, his kit is simple and as straightforward as it
                            can get to use. Stim Beacon instantly tosses down a stim beacon. Upon landing, it creates
                            a field that grants players a combat stim and a speed boost. Incendiary fires a grenade
                            that detonates as it comes to a rest on the floor, creating a lingering fire zone that
                            damages players within the zone. Some players create lineups with this ability so that
                            they can fire it from a safe distance away from a bomb plant to safely win rounds for
                            the team, others will find line ups to prevent the enemy team from planting the bomb.
                            Brimstone's signature ability Sky smokes fires to set locations where Brimstone's smoke
                            clouds will land, alternate fire to confirm, launching long-lasting smoke clouds that
                            block vision in selected areas. The inside of sky smoke contains debris, making it hard
                            for players inside to smoke to see each other until they're in close proximities.
                            Brimstone's Ultimate ability is called Orbital Strike,like Asta's ability this ability
                            will need to be charged via kills, deaths, and/or bomb plants/defuses. Orbital Strike
                            launches a lingering orbital strike laser at a targeted location, dealing high
                            damage-over-time to players caught within the area. This ability can be used as a safety
                            net to prevent enemies from planting/defusing the bomb from a safe distance away or it
                            may be used to prevent enemies from taking a certain chokepoint.

                        <p>
                            Hailing from India's coast, Harbor storms the field wielding ancient technology with
                            dominion over water. He unleashes frothing rapids and crushing waves to shield his
                            allies and to pummel those that oppose him. Harbor's four abilities are: CASCADE, COVE,
                            his signature ability HIGH TIDE, and his ultimate ability RECKONING. Harbor is the newest
                            addition to the controllers, While his kit mainly focuses on denying vision, it can also
                            be used to create opportunities for your team. Cascade equips a wave of water, when fired
                            it sends a wave of water rolling forward and through walls. Reactivate the ability to stop
                            the wall of water at it's current position, when players walk through or hit by the wave
                            they are slowed for a short period of time. Cove fires a sphere of shielding water, fire
                            to throw the orb normallying and alternate-fire to throw it underhand. Upon impact the sphere
                            a destructible water shield that will block a certain amount of bullets. This ability can be
                            used to smoke off chokepoints or can be used to protect an ally planter/defuser. High tide
                            equips a wall another wall of water, fire to send the water forward along the ground. Hold
                            the fire button to guide the water in the direction of your crosshair, passing through the
                            world, spawning a wall along the water's path. Alternate-fire while bending to stop the water
                            early, players that walk through or hit by the wall is slowed for a short duration. Like every
                            other agent, Habor's ultimate needs to be charged via kills, deaths and/or bomb plants/defuses.
                            Harbor's Ultimate Ability is called Reckoning, reckoning equips the full power of your
                            artifact, fire to summon a geyser pool on the ground. Enemy players in the area are targeted
                            by successive geyser strikes. Player caught within a strike are concussed, players that are
                            concussed will have screen distortion (player view may be blurred and/or shaky), hearing
                            impairment (temporary deafness), and movement impairment (players are slowed or partially
                            restricted).

                        <h3>Omen</h3>
                        <img id="agentBanner" src="/Users/Calvin/Desktop/Projects/AppAcademy/Introduction to HTML and CSS/Capstone1/images/agents/controllers/Omen/omenBanner2.png" alt="Omen Banner">

                        <p>
                            A phantom of a memory, Omen hunts in the shadows. He renders enemies blind, teleports across
                            the field, then lets paranoia take hold as his foe scrambles to learn where he might strike
                            next. Omen's four abilities are: SHROUDED STEP, PARANOIA, his signature ability DARK COVER,
                            and his ultimate ability FROM THE SHADOWS. Omen's kit is the most versatile among the controllers.
                            His abilities can be used more aggressively and/or passively depending on the player. Shrouded step
                            allows Omen to teleports to a marked location after a brief channel. This ability can be used
                            to get away from a dangerous situation, and/or used to aggressively take space to obtain a more
                            favorable/unexpected angle to suprise enemies. Paranoia allows Omen to equips a blinding orb that
                            travels through obstacles, fire to throw it forward in a straight line, briefly nearsighting and
                            deafening all players it touches. Omen's signature ability Dark Cover, equips a shadow orb, entering
                            a phased world to place and target the orbs. Press the ability key to fire the shadow orb to the marked
                            location, creating a long-lasting shadow sphere (smoke) that blocks vision. The inside of Dark Cover
                            is hollow, so players hiding inside the smoke can see anyone entering the smoke before they can see
                            the player hiding in the smoke. Omen's Dark Cover ability is considered a projectile, which means that
                            it can break some obstacles in the game. Omen players can use this neat trick on Ascent to fake position
                            and catch enemies offguard on Ascent. Dark Cover is also the easiest smoking ability to create one ways,
                            meaning that you can place smokes to your advantage where you can see enemy's lower portion of their body
                            while from their perspective they can't see anything. Omen's ultimate ability like the others need to be
                            charged via kills, death, and/or plant/defuses of the bomb. Omen's ultimate ability From the Shadows
                            allows the player to teleport to a targeted location anywhere on the map. While teleporting Omen will
                            appear as a Shade that can be destroyed by an enemy to cancel his teleport, or if omen reactivates his
                            ability to cancel the teleport.

                        <img id="agentBanner" src="/Users/Calvin/Desktop/Projects/AppAcademy/Introduction to HTML and CSS/Capstone1/images/agents/controllers/Viper/viperbanner2.jpeg" alt="Viper Banner">

                        <p>
                            The American chemist, Viper deploys an array of poisonous chemical devices to control the
                            battlefield and cripple the enemy's vision. If the toxins don't kill her prey, her mind games
                            surely will. Viper's four abilities are: SNAKE BITE, POISON CLOUD, her signature ability
                            is TOXIC SCREEN, and her ultimate ability is VIPER'S PIT. Viper's the only controller as of
                            right now that has passive abilities. Her passive abilities are Fuel and Toxin. Viper's passive
                            Fuel and Toxin work as a single passive. While fuel gradually generates and replenishes her
                            toxins (passive ability) that fuel her abilities, toxin inflict enemies that come into
                            contact with poison cloud, toxic screen, and vipers pit with decay. Players that are decayed
                            lose 30 health instantly and then 10 health per second for every addition second they're in
                            contact with the abilities mentioned above. Snake bite allows viper to launch a chemical canister
                            that shatters upon hitting the floor, creating a lingering chemincal zone that damages and applies
                            Vulnerability. Players that are Vulnerable take more damage from bullets and other abilities.
                            Poison Cloud throws a gas emitter that perpetually remains throughout the round. Alternate-fire
                            to lob the emitter. Re-use the ability to create a toxic gas cloud at the cost of Fuel. Poison
                            Cloud can be use more than once and can be picked up to be redeployed. Viper players will generally
                            place their Poison Cloud on top of the bomb so that it can be used in conjunction with her Snake
                            Bites. This is because her snake bite ability by itself is not strong enough to kill an enemy
                            that has full health, while using it in conjunction with the Poison Cloud, the decay helps
                            amplify Snake Bite's damage. Vipers signature ability Toxic Screen equips a gas emitter launcher
                            that penetrates terrain, it deploys a long line of gas emitters. Re-activate ability to create
                            a tall wall of toxic gas at the cost of Fuel. This ability can also be used more than once.
                            Viper's ultimate ability Viper's Pit needs to be charged like every other ultimate ability via kills,
                            deaths, and/or bomb plants/defuses. Viper's Pit allows viper to equip a chemical sprayer. Fire the
                            ability to spray a chemical cloud in all directions around the targeted area, creating a large cloud
                            that nearsights players and decays the health of enemies inside it. Hold the ability key to disperse
                            the chemical cloud early.

                <h2>Duelists</h2>
                <p>
                    Duelists are agents that are designated to take aggressive fights and put pressure on the enemy team. Their
                    primary role is to enter sites and engage in combat, providing their team with early map control and fragging
                    potential. They are typically equipped with abilities that allow them to take fights on their own terms and to
                    push past enemy defenses. This makes them effective at creating openings and disrupting the enemy's setup.
                    Duelists are often relied upon to secure early picks and to trade kills effectively. They require strong
                    mechanical skills, game sense, and map knowledge to excel in their role. Each duelist has a unique set of
                    abilities that complement their playstyle, and we'll explore these abilities in more detail as we review each
                    agent.

                        <p>
                            Representing her home country of South Korea, Jett's agile and evasive fighting style lets
                            her take risks no one else can. She runs circles around every skirmish, cutting enemies before
                            they even know what hit them. Jett's Kit is the most straight forward of the duelists but also
                            takes some time to get used to. Jett has five abilities: CLOUD BURST, UPDRAFT, her signature
                            ability TAILWIND, her ultimate ability BLADE STORM and her passive ability DRIFT. Drift allows
                            jett to glide through the air while falling by holding space button. This can help Jett players
                            get on to elevated surfaces without the use of her updraft ability. Cloud burst allows
                            Jett to instantly throw a projectile that expands into a brief vision-blocking cloud on impact with
                            a surface. Hold the ability key to curve the smoke in the direction of your crosshair. Updraft propels
                            jett upwards high into the air. Her signature ability tailwind prepares a gust of wind for a limited
                            time. Re-use the ability to propel Jett in the direction that she's moving. If Jett is standing still
                            she will be propelled forward. This ability is generally used as a repositioning tool when taking gun
                            fights. It allows Jett to take an aggressive fight and get out if the fight is unfavorable for her.
                            Jett's Ultimate ability needs to be charges via kills, deaths, and/or bomb plants/defuses before it can
                            be used. Her Ultimate Ability Blade Storm equips a set of highly accurate throwing knives, fire to throw
                            a single knife and recharge the set on kill. Alternate fire to fire all the knives but does not
                            recharge on kill. Jett players can take favorable fights with Blade Storm by using her ultimate in
                            conjunction with updraft, drift, and tailwind because of the high accuracy of Blade Storm.

                        <p>
                            Filipino Agent, Neon, surges forward at shocking speeds, discharging bursts of bioelectric radiance as
                            fast as her body generates it. She races ahead to catch enemies off guard, then strikes them down
                            quicker than lightning. While Neon's kit is also straight forward it's very difficult to use her
                            abilities in conjunction. Neon's five abilities are: FAST LANE, RELAY BOLT, her signature ability HIGH
                            GEAR, her ultimate ability OVERDRIVE, and her passive ability ENERGY. Energy is the fuel used to power
                            Neon's abilities High Gear and Overdrive. Using those abilities gradually consume Energy and getting a
                            kill instantly recharges Energy. Fast Lane allows Neon to fire two energy lines forward on the ground
                            that extends a short distance or until they hit a surface. The lines rise into walls that block vision.
                            Relay allows Neon to instantly fire an energy bolt that bounces off any surface once. Upon hitting each
                            surface, the bolt shocks the area below and above with a concussive blast. Players that are concussed
                            have blurred vision and shaky screen, slowed movement speed, and a slower fire rate. Neon's signature
                            ability High Gear instantly channels Neon's powers for increased speed. When charged alternate-fire to
                            trigger an electric slide. The slide recharges every 2 kills. If this ability is used with a expert
                            proficiency in movement manuevers it makes Neon a very hard target to hit. Neon's ultimate ability
                            needs to be charged via kills, deaths, and/or bomb plants/defuses. Neon's ultimate ability Overdrive
                            unleashes Neon's full power and speed for a short duration. Fire to channel the power into a deadly
                            lightning beam with high movement accuracy.

                        <p>
                            Hailing from the U.K., Phoenix's star power shines through in his fighting style, igniting the
                            battlefield with flash and flare. Whether he's got backup or not, he'll rush into a fight on his
                            own terms. Although Phoenix's curving flashing ability may take some time to master, once you become
                            proficient in using it, he can be a highly valuable addition to any team composition. Phoenix's five
                            abilities are: BLAZE, CURVE BALL, his signature ability HOT HANDS, his ultimate ability RUN IT BACK,
                            and his passive ability HEATING UP. Phoenix's passive ability, Heating Up allows Phoenix to passively
                            heal himself instead of taking damage when standing in his own fire. Blaze equips a flame wall, fire
                            to create a line of flames that move forward, creating a wall of fire that blocks vision and damages
                            players passing through it. Hold fire to bend the wall in the direction of your crosshair. Curveball
                            equips a flare ball that takes a curving path and detonates shortly after throwing. Fire to curve the
                            flare orb to the left, detonating and Blinding any players who see the orb. Players that are blind
                            can't see anything on the screen for a short amount of time. Alternate-fire to curve the flare orb to
                            the right. Phoenix's signature ability Hot Hands, equips a fireball that explodes after a set amount
                            of time or upon hitting the ground, creating a lingering fire zone that damages enemies. Alternate fire
                            to lob the fire ball instead of throwing it. Phoenix's ultimate ability Run It Back needs to be charges
                            just like all the other ultimate abilities via kills, deaths, and/or bomb plants/defuses. Run It Back
                            instantly places a marker at his current location, while this ability is active, dying or allowing the
                            timer to expire will end this ability and bring Phoenix back to the location with full health and the
                            amount of armor he had when the ability was cast.

                        <p>
                            Raze explodes out of Brazil with her big personality and big guns. With her blunt-force-trauma
                            playstyle, she excels at flushing entrenched enemies and clearing tight spaces with a generous dose
                            of “boom". Raze possesses the most explosive kit out of all the duelists, as her abilities revolve
                            around explosives. She can utilize these explosives to propel herself forward or deal massive damage
                            to enemies. Unlike the previously dueslists raze on have four abilities: BOOMBOT, BLAST PACKS, her
                            signature ability PAINT SHELLS, and her ultimate ability SHOWSTOPPER. Raze's first ability equips a
                            Boom Bot, when the fire button is clicked it will deploy a bot, causing it to travel in a straight
                            line on the ground, bouncing off walls. The Boom Bot will lock on to any enemies in its frontal cone
                            and chase them, exploding for heavy damage if it reaches them. Blast pack allows Raze to instantly
                            deploy a Blast Pack that will stick to surfaces, reusing the ability after deployment will detonate,
                            damaging and moving anything it hit. Raze players often use this ability to quickly traverse the
                            battlefield and gain a tactical advantage by propelling themselves forward into a site or directly
                            at the enemy. Raze's signature ability, Paint Shells, equips her with a cluster grenade that explodes
                            on impact, releasing smaller grenades that also detonate after a brief delay, dealing damage to enemies
                            caught in their blast radius. To use the ability, press the fire button to throw it directly, or press
                            the alternate-fire button to lob it. The ability will recharge after obtaining two kills. Raze's
                            ultimate ability like the other agents needs to be charged via kills, deaths, and/or bomb
                            plants/defuses. Raze's ultimate ability, Showstopper, equips her with a powerful rocket launcher that
                            deals massive area damage upon impact with any surface. Skilled Raze players often use this ability
                            in conjunction with Blast Packs to gain a strategic advantage by achieving a better angle for maximum
                            splash damage.

                        <p>
                            Forged in the heart of Mexico, Reyna dominates single combat, popping off with each kill she scores.
                            Her capability is only limited by her raw skill, making her highly dependent on performance. Reyna's
                            play style is focused on aggressive pushing and individual fragging, allowing her to move quickly and
                            eliminate enemies with ease. She is best suited for players who are confident in their abilities to
                            secure kills and want to play a high-risk, high-reward style. Reyna's five abilities are: LEER, her
                            signature abilities are DEVOUR and DISMISS, her ultimate ability is called EMPRESS, and her passive
                            ability is called SOUL HARVEST. Soul Harvest provides Reyna with Soul Orbs if they die to her, or die
                            within 3 seconds of taking damage from Reyna. These Soul Orbs are then used for her signature abilities.
                            Leer equips Reyna with an etheral, destructible eye. Activate the cast the eye a short distance forward.
                            The eye will nearsight all enemies that are have the eye in their field of view. Reyna signature
                            abilities are Devour and Dismiss. Devour instantly consumes a nearby soul orb, rapidly healing Reyna
                            for a short duration and can be disrupted by taking damage. Health gained through this skill exceeding
                            100 will decay over time. If her ultimate is active, this skill will automatically cast and will not
                            consume the Soul Orb. Dismiss instantly consumes a nearby Soul Orb, becoming intangible for a short
                            duration, while intangible Reyna cannot use and abilities/weapons and is immune to damage. If her
                            ultimate is active, she will also become invisible when the ability is activated. Reyna's ultimate
                            ability Empress needs to be charges via kills, deaths, and/or bomb plants/defuses. While Empress is
                            active, Reyna instantly enters a frenzy, gaining a Combat Stim (faster fire rate and reload speed).
                            She also gains infinite charges on her signature abilities. When an enemy dies to Reyna, or dies
                            within 3 seconds of taking damage from Reyna, the duration of Empress is renewed.

                        <p>
                            Japanese native Yoru rips holes straight through reality to infiltrate enemy lines unseen. Using
                            deception and aggression in equal measure, he gets the drop on each target before they know where
                            to look. Yoru is the most disruptive and sneaky of the duelists. His abilities revolve around him
                            distracting his opponents. Yoru like Raze doesn't have a passive. His four abilities are: FAKEOUT,
                            BLINDSIDE, his signature ability GATECRASH, and his ultimate ability DIMENSIONAL DRIFT. Fakeout
                            allows Yoru to equip an echo that transform into a mirror image of Yoru when activated. Fire to
                            instantly activate the mirror image and send it forward. Alternate-fire to place an inactive echo.
                            Use your interact key to transform an inactive echo into a mirror image and send it forward. Mirror
                            images explode in a Blinding Flash when destroed by enemies. Blindside equips an unstable dimensional
                            fragment from reality. The fire button throws the fragment, activating a flash that winds up once it
                            collides with a hard surface. His signature ability Gatecrash equips a rift tether, fire to send the
                            tether forward, alternate-fire to place a stationary tether activate the ability to teleport to the
                            tether's location, use the interact key to trigger a fake teleport. Yoru's ultimate like the others
                            needs to be charged via kills, death, and/or bomb plants/defuses. Yoru's ultimate ability Dimensional
                            Drift equips a mask that can see between dimensions. The fire key allows Yoru to drift into his
                            dimension, unable to be affected or seen by enemies from the outside. In Dimension Drift, Yoru players
                            can use Gatecrash to teleport to a different site and retrieve the bomb if it was dropped in a
                            hard-to-reach location surrounded by enemies. This allows for a quick and unexpected plant while also
                            preventing the risk of trading lives to retrieve the bomb.

                <p>
                    initiators are agents whose primary role is to start or initiate a fight with the enemy team. They use their
                    abilities to gather information on enemy positions, create space for their team to move in, and make it
                    difficult for the enemy team to hold a position. Although all initiators have the same role, their abilites
                    vary so that their playstyles are very different from each other. We'll discuss the abilities in more detail
                    as we review each agents.

                            Breach, the bionic Swede, fires powerful, targeted kinetic blasts to aggressively clear a path through
                            enemy ground. The damage and disruption he inflicts ensures no fight is ever fair. Breach's playstyle
                            revolves around creating opportunities for his team to take control of a site or gain an advantage in
                            a firefight. His abilities that allow him to disrupt enemy positions and open up new angles of attack.
                            Breach's four abilities are: AFTERSHOCK, FLASHPOINT, his signature ability FAULT LINES, and his ultimate
                            ability ROLLING THUNDER. Aftershock equips a fusion charge into breach's arm and fires a slow-acting burst
                            into any surface. The burst does heavy damage to anyone caught in its area. Flashpoint equips a blinding
                            charge. Fire the charge to set a fast-acting burst through any surface. The charge detonates to blind all
                            players looking at it. His signature ability Fault Lines equips a seismic blast, hold fire to increase the
                            distance, release to set off the quake, concussing all players in its zone and in a line up to the zone.
                            Breach's ultimate ability like the other ultimate abilities needs to be charges via kills, deaths, and/or
                            bomb plants/defuses. Breach's ultimate ability Rolling Thunder equips a seismic charge. Fire button sends
                            a cascading quake through all terrain in a large cone. The qukae concusses and knocks up anyone caught
                            inside the zone. Players that are concussed have their vision blurred, movement speed slowed, and fire-rate
                            slowed for a brief duration.

                        <p>
                            Turkish bounty hunter Fade unleashes the power of raw nightmare to seize enemy secrets. Attuned with
                            terror itself, she hunts down targets and reveals their deepest fears - before crushing them in the
                            dark. Fade's playstyle specializes in pinpointing enemy locations as well as flushing them out. Her
                            utlities revolve around marking a target and causing distress by deafening any players hit with her
                            utility. Fade's five abilities are: PROWLER, SEIZE, her signature ability HAUNT, her ultimate ability
                            NIGHTFALL, and her passive ability Terror Trail. Her passive ability applies a terror trail that marks
                            enemies, causing their position and movement to be tracked by dark mist. Prowler can be used to pursue
                            trails. Fade's first ability prowler sends a "prowley" forward, hold the fire button to steer the
                            prowler in the direction of your crosshair. The prowler will chase down the first enemy or terror trail
                            that it sees, and nearsight the enemy on impact. Her ability seize throws a knot of raw fear. The knot
                            drops down after a short period of time, however you can drop the seize early by reactivating the ability.
                            The knot ruptures on impact, holding nearby enemies in place. Enemies that are held in place are Deafened
                            and Decayed (loses a set amount of health that is later regenerated if no damage is taken while decayed).
                            Her signature ability Haunt, throws a haunting watcher that drops down after a set amount of time, you
                            can drop the haunt earlier by reactivating the ability. The haunting watcher lashes out on impact and
                            reveals enemies in its line of sight and creating terror trails to each enemy revealed. Enemies can
                            destroy the watcher. Fade's ultimate ability like the others needs to be charged via kills, deaths,
                            and/or bomb plants/defuses. Nightfall equips the power of nightmare itself, and unleashes a wave of

                        <p>
                            Gekko the Angeleno leads a tight-knit crew of calamitous creatures. His buddies bound forward, scattering
                            enemies out of the way, with Gekko chasing them down to regroup and go again. Gekko's abilities are
                            powerful when used individually, but when utilized together they provide a wealth of information and
                            can be extremely challenging to counter. Gekko's five abilities are: MOSH PIT, WINGMAN, his signature
                            ability DIZZY, his ultimate ability THRASH, and his passive ability GLOBULES. His first ability most
                            pit throws a mosh like a grenade that upon landing spreads across a large area then after a short
                            delay explodes. You can throw this ability underhand with the alternate-fire button. His second ability
                            sends Wingman forward seeking enemies. Wingman unleashes a concussive blast towards the first enemy he
                            sees, players that are concussed will have a blurred screen with reduced movement speed and slower
                            fire-rate. Alternate-fire when targeting a spike site or planted spike will send Wingman forward to
                            either defuse or plant the spike. To plant the spike Gekko must have the spike in his inventory. His
                            signature ability sends Dizzy soaring forward through the air. Dizzy charges then unleashes plasma
                            blasts at enemies in line of sight. Enemies that are hit with her plasma are blinded. Enemies that are
                            blinded by Dizzy will have goo-like substance on their screen for a brief period. Gekko's ultimate
                            ability ultimate ability like the others needs to be charged via kills, deaths, and/or bomb plants/defuses.
                            Thrash links Gekko to Thrash's mind and steer her through enemy territory. Activate to lunge forward
                            and explode, detaining any players in a small radius. Gekko's passive allows Wingman, Dizzy, and Thrash
                            to revert into a dormant globule after they are used. Gekko then has a brief period where he can interact
                            with the globules to reclaim them and gain another charge of the ability after a short duration. Thrash
                            can only be reclaimed once.

                        <p>
                            KAY/O is a machine of war built for a single purpose: neutralizing radiants. His power to suppress
                            enemy abilities cripples his opponents' capacity to fight back, securing him and his allies the
                            ultimate edge. His playstyle revolves around disruption and disabling enemy abilities. His
                            abilities are designed to counter enemy utility and to gather information on enemy locations.
                            KAY/O's four abilities are: FRAG/MENT, FLASH/DRIVE, his signature ability ZERO/POINT, his ultimate
                            ability NULL/CMD. FRAG/MENT throws a fragment grenade that sticks to the floor and explodes multiple
                            times, dealing near lethal damage at the center with each explosion. Alternate-fire to lob the grenade
                            instead of throwing it. His second ability FLASH/DRIVE equips a flash grenande, FIRE to throw it
                            overhand and alternate-fire to lob a weaker version that explodes quicker. The flash grenande explodes
                            after a short fuse, blinding anyone in line of sight. His signature ability ZERO/POINT equips a
                            suppression blade that sticks to the first surface it hits when thrown, winds up, and suppresses anyone
                            in the radius of that explosion. His ultimate ability ultimate ability like the others needs to be
                            charged via kills, deaths, and/or bomb plants/defuses. NULL/CMD instantly overload with polarized
                            radianite energy that pulses from KAY/O in a massive radius. Enemies that are hit with the pulses are
                            suppressed for a short duration. While overloaded, KAY/O gains combat stim and can be re-stabilized
                            if downed. Players that are suppressed are unable to use abilities for a brief period.

                        <p>
                            Hailing from Australia, Skye and her band of beasts trail-blaze the way through hostile territory.
                            With her creations hampering the enemy, and her power to heal others, the team is strongest and
                            safest by Skye's side. Skye's playstyle revolves around supporting her team with her abilities.
                            She is capable of scouting out enemies and providing valuable intel and support to her team. Skye's
                            four abilities are: REGROWTH, TRAILBLAZER, her signature ability GUIDING LIGHT, and her ultimate
                            ability SEEKERS. Skye's first ability regrowth equips Skye with a healing trinket, the fire button
                            channels the trinket and heals allies in range and line of sight. Regrowth can be reused until her
                            healing pool is depleted. Skye cannot heal herself. Trailblazer equips a tasmanian tiger trinket,
                            fire to send out and take control of the predator, while in control the fire button causes the tiger
                            to leap forward, exploding in a concussive blast and damaging directly hit enemies. Her signature
                            ability Guiding Light equips a flashing hawk trinket. The fire button sends the hawk forward, hold the
                            fire button to guide the hawk in the direction of your crosshair. Re-activate the ability while the hawk
                            is in flight to transform the hawk into a flash. The flash reaches max potency after a short duration
                            during the hawk's flight. Skye's ultimate ability like all the others needs to be charged via kills,
                            deaths, and/or bomb plants/defuses. Her ultimate ability seekers sends out three Seekers to track down
                            the three closest enemies. If a seeker reaches its target, it Nearsights them. Enemies that are near
                            sighted have a shorted range of view and can only see enemies that are within close proximities for a
                            short duration.

                        <p>
                            Born from the eternal winter of Russia's tundra, Sova tracks, finds, and eliminates enemies with
                            ruthless efficiency and precision. His custom bow and incredible scouting abilities ensure that
                            even if you run, you cannot hide. Sova's playstyle revolves around gathering information and
                            providing support to his team. His abilities are focused on reconnaissance and disruption,
                            allowing him to locate enemies and weaken their positions. Sova's four abilities are: OWL DRONE,
                            SHOCK BOLT, his signature ability RECON BOLT, and his ultimate ability HUNTER'S FURY. Sova's Owl
                            Drone ability deploys and takes control the movement of a drone to scout areas for enemies and
                            can even fire a dart that will reveal enemies for a brief period of time if hit. Shock Bolt fires
                            an arrow that upon contact with any surface will detonate an explosive shock that will damage
                            enemies that are caught within it's range. You can add up to two bounces on this ability and
                            holding the fire button will charge up the range of the projectile. Sova's signature ability
                            Recon Bolt shoots a destructible arrow from his bow that can attach to any surface. Upon landing,
                            it will reveal enemies caught in the line of sight of the arrow. Hold down the fire button to draw
                            the bow further back and increase the power of the shot. Releasing the button fires the arrow.
                            Additionally, you can add two bounces to this ability, similar to the Shock Bolt with the
                            alternate-fire button. Sova's ultimate ability like the others needs to be charged via kills, deaths,
                            and/or bomb plants/defuses before it can be used. Hunter's Fury equips Sova with a bow that can fire
                            three long-range, wall-piercing energy blasts in a straight line in front of Sova. Hunter's Fury will
                            damage and reveal all enemies that are caught in the line of fire for a short period of time. This
                            ability can be fire three times total, and each energy blast deals massive damage to the enemies hit.

                <p>
                    A Sentinel is a defensive-oriented agent whose primary role is to protect the team's designated sites or
                    areas. They do this by using their abilities to slow down or deny enemy movements, gather information,
                    and provide cover for their teammates. Sentinels typically play a supportive role, staying back and holding
                    down key positions on the map with traps, barriers, and alarms. They often act as the anchor of the team,
                    providing the backbone of the defensive strategy and preventing the enemy from gaining too much ground.

                        <p>
                            Well dressed and well armed, French weapons designer Chamber expels aggressors with deadly precision.
                            He leverages his custom arsenal to hold the line and pick off enemies from afar, with a contingency
                            built for every plan. Chambers abilities as a sentinel differ from the rest. His kit allows him to
                            play as a more aggressive type of sentinel. His four abilities are: TRADEMARK, HEAD HUNTER, his
                            signature ability RENDEZVOUS, and his ultimate ability TOUR DE FORCE. Chamber is classified as a
                            sentinel due to his ability Trademark. Trademark places a trap that scans for enemies on the floor.
                            When a visible enemy comes in range, the trap counts down and destabilizes the terrain around them,
                            creating a lingering field that slows players caught inside of it, while also notifying your team
                            that someone has set your trap off. Trademark can be picked up to be redeployed during the round.
                            Headhunter equips Chamber with a heavy pistol that can be scoped in with alternate-fire. His signature
                            ability Rendezvous places down a teleporting anchor on the ground. While Chamber is on the ground and
                            within the range of Rendezvous, reactivating the ability will quickly teleport Chamber to the anchors
                            position. Rendezvous can be picked up to be redployed during the same round. Chamber players will
                            generally take advantage of this ability by taking an aggressive peak, getting a kill, and then
                            teleporting out. Chamber's ultimate ability like the rest of the agents needs to be charged via kill,
                            deaths, and/or bomb plants/defuses before he can use it. Tour de Force equips Chamber with a custom
                            sniper that will kill enemies with any direct hit to the upper body and up. killing enemies with Tour
                            de Force will create a lingering field that slows players caught in the field.

                        <p>
                            The Moroccan information broker, Cypher is a one-man surveillance network who keeps tabs on the enemy’s
                            every move. No secret is safe. No maneuver goes unseen. Cypher is always watching. Cypher's playstyle
                            revolves around setting up traps and gathering intel on enemy movements. His abilities allow him to
                            create a web of traps and cameras across the map, giving him and his team a significant advantage in
                            terms of information. Cypher's four abilities are: TRAPWIRE, CYBER CAGE, his signature ability SPYCAM,
                            and his ultimate ability NEURAL THEFT. Trapwire places a destructible covert tripwire at the targeted
                            location, creating a line that spans between two surfaces (there's a limited range). Enemy players who
                            cross the tripwire will be tethered (unable to move to a certain extent), revealed (highlighted through
                            smokes, walls, and other obstacles), and concussed after a short brief period of time if they don't
                            destroy the device in time. This ability can be picked up to be redeployed in the same round. Cyber Cage
                            instantly tosses a device on the floor in front of him. This can be activated to create a zone that
                            blocks off vision and plays an audio cue when enemies pass through it. The inside of this cage is hollow,
                            therefore players inside the smoke can see each other. His signature ability Spy Cam places a covert
                            camera at a targeted location, Cypher is limited to how far away he can place the cam from his current
                            location. Re-use the ability to take control of the camera's view. While in control of the cam, fire to
                            shoot a marking dart, this dart will reveal the location of any enemy hit by the dart until the dart is
                            taken off. His ultimate ability like the others need to be charged via kills, deaths, and/or bomb
                            plants/defuses before it can be used. Neural Theft can only be used on a targeted enemy corpse to
                            download information on their team's position. After a brief delay, the location of all living enemy
                            players will be revealed. The location will be revealed again after another short delay.

                            The genius of Germany, Killjoy secures the battlefield with ease using her arsenal of inventions. If
                            the damage from her gear doesn't stop her enemies, her robots debuff will help make short work of
                            them. Killjoy's playstyle is focused on setting up traps and holding positions. Her abilities allow
