                    team synergy and agent compatibility with maps with your team against other
                    players. Valorant requires patience, precision, and communication. If you are
                    new to the game of Valorant you may want to stick around. This website provides
                    information on the different types of agents and their roles, the different maps
                    that are in the game, and the different types of game modes. Use this information
                    to your advantage and learn as much as you can before throwing yourself into the
                    game!

                    There are multiple agents in Valorant and they are separated into 4 different roles.
                    The 4 roles designated roles are: Initiator, Duelist, Controller, and Sentinel. Each
                    role serves a general function, each character that fall in a specific role does the
                    specified responsibilities in different ways. Click the Agent tab to learn more about
                    the agents and their roles.

                <p>
                    Just like there are multiple agents in Valorant there are also multiple maps. There are
                    9 maps in valorant: Bind, Split, Haven, Icebox, Pearl, Fracture, Breeze, Ascent, and Lotus.
                    Each map is unique and different from the others. The primary objective of having multiple
                    maps is to facilitate variable creation from one game to the next. The maps will go on
                    rotation with the start of a new season. Each map has a handful of agents that can
                    optimally use their utility. While some agents are good and played more often on some
                    maps, they can also be picked less on other maps.

                    just want to relax and enjoy the gameplay. Then there's a competitive where you face other
                    competitive players and wager your rank rating and climb the rank ladder to achieve the best
                    rank you can. There are other game modes too for the more casual players. There's swiftplay and
                    spike rush for those who are on a time crunch and can't play a full game. Deathmatch is a
                    free-for-all,
                    perfect for competitive players warming up for their games. From time to time Valorant will also
