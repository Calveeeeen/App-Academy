                    <p>
                        Ascent is a map set in Italy that features a large, open middle area that both teams can skirmish over. Mid
                        is a playground for diverse ability use and successfully controlling the area opens additional routes for
                        Attackers to both Spike sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The map's 'unique' features include mechanical doors leading into sites. Each site has one door (A Link for
                        A and Market for B) that is opened at the start of each round. Players can use a switch on the site side of
                        the door (Next to the door on A and on a table in Toolshed on B) to close or open the door. These doors are
                        impenetrable while closed but have 500 HP, allowing players to damage and eventually destroy them. Once
                        destroyed, the doorway remains permanently open for the rest of the round.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The two walls separating Courtyard from Link also have a destructible panel each to cover them. Whilst
                        intact, they absorb damage and cannot be penetrated by gunfire. The panels however have 400 HP each and can
                        be damaged, with colored indicators on them implying how much health they have left (starts blue, then turns
                        yellow and then red as they take more damage). They can eventually be destroyed to allow players to wallbang
                        through these walls for the rest of the round.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Bind's "unique" feature is that it doesn't contain a mid section, instead having two one-way teleporters.
                        One takes players from A Short to B Short and the other takes players from B Long to A Lobby.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Players use teleporters by walking into the section of wall taken up by the teleport entrance. They will
                        then instantly arrive in a small exit room which players leave by walking towards the door out of the room.
                        This door is closed by default and can only be opened by players inside the exit room walking up to it, at
                        which point they will open automatically. Players outside the exit room cannot open these doors, but they
                        can be penetrated by gunfire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other objects can also be sent through teleporters if they come into contact with the teleporter entrance.
                        They will maintain any velocity they had before being teleported and can open the doors and leave the exit
                        room should they travel far enough to trigger the door sensor. Objects include abilities, the spike, and
                        dropped weapons. Whenever a teleporter is used by an agent or an object, all players on the map will be
                        given an audio cue.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="mapFracture">
                    <h2 id="Fracture">Fracture</h2>
                    <img id="mapImage" src="/Users/Calvin/Desktop/Projects/AppAcademy/Introduction to HTML and CSS/Capstone1/images/maps/fractureMap1.webp" alt="image of the map: Fracture">
                    <p>
                        Fracture's unique design splits up the map into four neutral quadrants, four central areas between the
                        quadrants that contain the sites and Attacker spawns, and a central zone where Defenders spawn. On Round
                        Start, Defenders can access the sites, which are on opposite sides of the map. Attackers all spawn in
                        one area, but can reach the other side by using the cross-map ziplines that take them underneath Defender
                        Spawn. During the Buy Phase, Defenders are unable to hear Attackers using the ziplines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each quadrant contains one orb, meaning Fracture has a total of four orbs as opposed to the usual total of
                        two orbs that are present on most other maps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A Hall contains an automatic door that works similarly to the exit room doors for Bind's teleporters, as it
                        will instantly open once a player gets close enough, making a loud audio cue as it does, and will also open
                        for any abilities thrown towards it. This door on Fracture however will also open for entities on both sides
                        of the door.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Ziplines</h4>
                    <p>
                        Fracture features two parallel one-way ziplines that bisect the map. These ziplines do not act like ziplines
                        found on other maps, and have special rules to their interactions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Upon attaching, the player will automatically move across the zipline at full speed</li>
                        <li>Whilst attached, players cannot:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Change directions</li>
                            <li>Use abilities</li>
                            <li>Detach</li>
                            <li>Stop (although you can still slow yourself down holding Shift)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>
                            If the spike carrier drops the spike or gets killed whilst using the ziplines, the spike will respawn on
                            the closer side of the zipline.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        Haven's unique features include an additional third spike site. This does not affect the number of ultimate
                        orbs on the map; Haven's two ultimate orbs are present in A Long and C Long.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The doors at Mid also have destructible panels covering them. Whilst intact, they absorb damage and cannot
                        be penetrated by gunfire. The panels however have 400 HP each and can be damaged, with colored indicators on
                        them implying how much health they have left (starts blue, then turns yellow and then red as they take more
                        damage). They can eventually be destroyed to allow players to wallbang through these doors for the rest of
                        the round.

                    <p>
                        Lotus contains multiple features spread out across the map. It's VALORANT's second three-site map but unlike
                        the game's first three-site map of Haven, Lotus has a third ultimate orb available to be claimed at mid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two of the map's features are present at the back of A Site. A rope ascender is available to take players
                        from A Site to A Top. When players go down from A Top to A Drop, their fall is silenced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A unique feature to Lotus is its rotating doorways. It has one on A Side standing between A Main and A Tree,
                        and another on C Side standing between C Mound and B Main. The doors can be activated from either side using
                        a toggle button, at which point the door will rotate 180° over 8 seconds, giving players a small window where
                        they can pass through to the other side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A destructible wall also stands between A Main and A Link. Whilst intact, it absorbs damage and cannot be
                        penetrated by gunfire. The wall however has 400 HP and can be damaged, with colored indicators on it implying
                        how much health it has left (starts blue, then turns yellow and then red as it takes more damage). It can
                        eventually be destroyed to allow players to pass through a passageway between A Main and A Link for the rest
                        of the round.

                    <p>
                        Pearl is a two-site three-lane map. Following on from the release of more strategically complex maps like
                        Icebox, Breeze, and Fracture, Pearl is designed as a more traditional map. As a result, Pearl is the first
                        map to be released that does not contain any dynamic elements or mechanical hooks for gameplay.

                    <p>
                        Split was the first map to use ascenders (vertical ropes). There are three sets on the map:

                    <p>
                        The Range is a practice map where players can test their skills with the parkour course, train your spike
                        planting/defusing skills, test different abilities on every agent, and try out different weapons.

                <p>
                    Breeze's 'unique' features are present on the A side of the map, mostly to do with A Hall. There are ropes to get
                    players into A Hall. On the defending side players can use the rope at the back of A Site to get onto Bridge and
                    into Hall, and on the attacking side players can use the rope in A Lobby to get into Hall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Site has an impenetrable, indestructible mechanical door leading into A Hall that can be opened and closed using
                    switches on either side. The door is closed at the start of each round.

                <p>
                    Towards the Attacker side of Hall is a one-way chute (also known as a 'vent') that can be used to go to Mid.

                <p>
                    Icebox is the first map to introduce horizontal ziplines, seen at the A Site. Each Icebox site is a complex
                    combat space that features plenty of cover and verticality. This map emphasizes skirmishes, sharp aim, and
                    adaptive play.

                <p>
                    It is also the first map where the plant site has different levels of elevation. Both sites contain nests that
