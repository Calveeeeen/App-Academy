            <h3>Unrated</h3>

            <p>Unrated is a game mode in Valorant that allows players to play in a more casual setting without the pressure of losing rank points. In this mode, players
                can still compete and play with other players, but the outcome of the match doesn't affect their rank.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unrated is often used as a warm-up game mode or a way for players to practice their skills in a more relaxed environment. It is also a great way for new
                players to get used to the mechanics of the game and learn the different maps and agents.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rules of the game are the same as the competitive mode, with the exception that there are no ranks and the games do not affect the player's MMR
                (Matchmaking Rating) or Elo. Players can still communicate and strategize with their team, but the game is generally less serious and more laid-back
                compared to competitive mode.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Competitive</h3>

            <p>
                The Competitive game mode in Valorant is a 5v5 mode that involves two teams, the attacking team, and the defending team. The attacking team's objective
                is to plant a bomb (known as the Spike) at one of the designated sites on the map and defend it until it explodes. The defending team's objective is to
                prevent the attacking team from planting the Spike or defuse it if it's already planted. The first team to win 13 rounds out of a maximum of 24 rounds
                wins the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Competitive mode also includes a ranked system where players are placed into ranks based on their performance in previous matches. The ranking
                system uses a rating called the "Elo system," which adjusts based on wins, losses, and personal performance. The more a player wins, the higher their
                rank becomes. Winning matches against higher-ranked teams will result in more rank increases than winning against lower-ranked teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                To participate in the Competitive mode, players must reach level 5 and complete a set of placement matches to determine their initial rank. Players are
                then matched with others of similar skill level. The Competitive mode is considered the most challenging game mode in Valorant and is where players can
                test their skills against other highly skilled players.

            <h3>Swift play</h3>

            <p>
                Swiftplay is a best-of-nine spike (Plant/Defuse) mode. It has most of the same gameplay rules as Unrated but with the following changes to adjust for its
                shorter duration:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>All player start each half with two points for their ultimate.</li>
                <li>No credit bonuses for loss streaks.</li>
                <li>Credits earned based on round outcome have adjusted values and are the same for both teams, with the exception of round 2.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Spike Rush</h3>

            <p>
                Spike Rush is a fast-paced, casual game mode in Valorant. In Spike Rush, each team consists of five players and the objective is to plant or defuse the
                Spike, just like in the standard game mode. However, there are several key differences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, Spike Rush matches are much shorter than standard matches, usually lasting around 10 minutes. Secondly, every player starts the match with the
                same weapon, and powerful abilities and weapons are randomly given throughout the match, which changes every round. This makes for a more chaotic and
                unpredictable game experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another difference is that the Spike explodes much faster in Spike Rush, usually taking only seven seconds to detonate after it is planted. This makes the
                gameplay more fast-paced and intense, as players have less time to react and defuse the Spike.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, Spike Rush is a fun and fast-paced game mode that offers a different type of gameplay experience compared to the more serious and competitive
                standard and ranked game modes in Valorant.

            <h3>Deathmatch</h3>

            <p>
                Deathmatch is a game mode in Valorant where players compete against each other in a free-for-all battle. The objective of this mode is to score as many
                kills as possible within a set time limit. Unlike other modes, there is no spike to plant or defuse, and no teams to work with. Players are able to
                respawn immediately after they die and are provided with unlimited money to purchase weapons and abilities. The first player to reach a set amount of
                kills, or the player with the most kills at the end of the time limit, is declared the winner. This mode is often used for warm-ups or for players to
                practice their aim and improve their skills.

            <h3>Escalation</h3>

            <p>
                Escalation is a game mode in Valorant where two teams compete to level up their weapons through a series of progressively more challenging rounds. At
                the beginning of each round, all players on both teams are given the same randomly selected weapon, and the goal is to score a certain number of kills
                with it to progress to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>
                As players progress, the weapons they receive become increasingly powerful and challenging to use, adding an extra layer of difficulty and excitement
                to the game. The first team to reach the final level and get a kill with the designated golden gun wins the match.
            </p>
            <p>
                Escalation is a fast-paced and fun game mode that allows players to experiment with different weapons and practice their aim in a competitive setting.
                It's a great way for new players to learn the game and for experienced players to test their skills in a fresh and exciting way.

            <h3>Replication</h3>

            <p>Replication is a limited-time game mode in Valorant that was introduced in patch 3.05. In this game mode, each player on the team will play with the same
                randomly selected agent, with the agents changing every round. This means that both teams will have the same agents in each round, making it a test of
                skill and strategy with each team starting on an even playing field.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Replication, all abilities have increased charges, which makes for a more chaotic and fast-paced gameplay experience. This game mode also has a unique
                twist in that each player can earn a "replicant ult point" by getting a kill, which can be used to activate their ultimate ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Replication has three rounds with the team that wins two of those rounds emerging victorious. The first team to reach 13 round wins will be declared the
                winner.

            <h3>Snowball Fight</h3>

            <p>
                Snowball Fight is a 5v5 team deathmatch-style mode where the first team to 50 kills wins. All players load into game with an agent of their choice and only
                have access to a Snowball Launcher. This weapon fires projectile-based snowballs that have a travel time and an arc. The Snowball Launcher has infinite
                ammo but can only fire one snowball at a time with a small reload in between shots. Snowballs deal 150 damage upon coming into contact with an enemy player.
            </p>
            <p>
                Snowball Fight grants 750 XP for each game completed, and 150 bonus XP for the winning team, but cannot be used to progress missions.
